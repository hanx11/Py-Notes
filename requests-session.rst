Session Objects
---------------

The Session object allows you to persist certain parameters across requests.
It also persists cookies across all requests made from the Session instance,
and will use urllib3's connection pooling. So if you're making several requests
to the same host, the underlying TCP connection will be reused, which can result
in a significant performance increase.

A Session object has all the methods of the main Requests API.

Let's persist some cookies across requests:

.. code:: python 
    
    s = requests.Session()
    s.get('http://httpbin.org/cookies/set/sessioncookie/123456789')
    r = s.get('http://httpbin.org/cookies')
    print(r.text)
    # '{"cookies": {"sessioncookie": "123456789"}}'

 Session can also be used to provide default data to the request methods. This
 is done by providing data to the properties on a Session object:

 .. code:: python
    
    s = requests.Session()
    s.auth = ('user': 'pass')
    s.headers.update({'x-text': 'true'})

    # both 'x-test' and 'x-test2' are sent
    s.get('http://httpbin.org/headers', headers={'x-test2': 'true'})

Any dictionaries that you pass to a request method will be merged with the session-
level values that are set. The method-level parameters override session parameters.

Note, however, that method-level parameters will not be persisted across requests, 
even if using a session. This example will only send the cookies with the first 
request, but not the second:

.. code:: python

    s = requests.Session()
    r = s.get('http://httpbin.org/cookies', cookies={'from-my': 'browser'})
    print(r.text)
    # '{"cookies": {"from-my": "browser"}}'

    r = s.get('http://httpbin.org/cookies')
    print(r.text)
    # '{"cookies": {}}'

If you want to manually add cookies to your session, use the Cookie utility functions
to manipulate Session.cookies.

Sessions can also be used as context managers:

.. code:: python

    with requests.Session() as s:
        s.get('http://httpbin.org/cookies/set/sessioncookie/123456789')

This will make sure the session is closed as soon as the with block is existed, even if
unhandled exceptions occurred.

All values that are contained within a session are directly available to you.
